1.e4 b6 {The Queen's Fianchetto opening. An early fianchetto by Black shows 
a willingness to defend against a big pawn center, picking away at it from 
the wings. In ceding so much territory, Black must be on constant guard 
against direct attacks on the King, as this game amply illustrates.}

{The unofficial world championship. The leading player after Labourdonnais 
in France was the colorful Pierre St. Amant, who served was secretary to 
the governor of French Guiana -- until he protested against the slave 
trade. Later he tried his hand as an actor, then became a successful wine 
merchant, and was a captain in the National Guard during the 1948 
revolution. In 1851 he became the French consul to California eight years 
after the Englishman Howard Staunton bested him in a series of memorable 
matches. On a visit to London St. Amant defeated Staunton 3.5 - 2.5 for a 
stake of one guinea. This led to a demand for a return match just before 
Christmas in the same year, which was won by Staunton 13-8, marking an end 
to French chess supremacy. Here, in an almost symmetrical position, 
White's sway over the open e-file enables him to launch a combination of 
unusual beauty. Like so many other losers, however, St. Amant at least had 
the satisfaction of winning the most brilliant game.} 1. d4 e6 2. c4 d5

fit this now-historic match into the Christmas holidays. In some cases, two
games were played in one day. This game and many others in the series give
lie to the myth that Anderssen was interested only in attacks on the King.
Here he answers a sharp assault on the Sicilian - repeated by Fischer more
than a century later - with equal energy. The result is a violent miniature.

thrashes his teacher Anderssen (often considered the world's best player
when Morphy retired) after dropping the first three games. This one proved
to be the turning point of the match, and it shows how notions of beauty

Europe to compete in his first international tournament -- and won, ahead of
names like Lasker, Tarrasch and Chigorin. Though a frequent and successful
tournament player, he never obtained the match for the world championship he
sought, and his early death in 1906 deprived the world of one of its
greatest players. Among other things, Pillsbury showed the worth of the
Queen's Gambit in an era when anything other than 1.e4 e5 was often dubbed

research has shown that the match terms forced the challenger to win by two

{Lasker saw chess, above all, as a struggle. Strength of character and iron
nerves enabled him to occupy the throne for 25 years, from 1894-1921, longer
than anyone else. Here he saved his title on a 5-5 tie after losing game
five but came from behind to win a drawn position in the final game (see
Lasker-Schlechter, game 10). Eight other games were drawn. The outcome might
have been very different had Lasker lost this game. He was outplayed, but
desperate ingenuity rescued what looked like a hopeless endgame two pawns
down (also see his miraculous save against Edward Lasker at New York 1924).

stood a point and a half ahead of his nearest rivals Lasker and Tarrasch.
When he met Lasker again in the seventh of the ten final rounds, even a draw
would virtually assure the Cuban of first place. But Lasker, the great chess
psychologist, adopted an opening in which Black might indeed try for the
advantage, but could not readily obtain a draw. The result was a great

situation, for the Exchange Variation is generally considered to allow Black
equality. But the equality is of a dynamic nature, as Black must use his two
Bishops to counterbalance White's Kingside pawn majority, and the sort play
in which Capablanca excelled -- gradual simplification to a technical
endgame -- will not do, for each exchange of pieces brings White closer to a
won King-and-pawn ending.} 7... Bd6 8. Nc3 Ne7 9. O-O O-O 10. f4 Re8 11. Nb3

for a Knight and the h2-b8 diagonal for his Bishop.} 12... b6 13. Bf4 Bb7

probably regretted it the rest of his life," says Gene Hackman, starring as
a weary private eye who tinkers with a pocket set during stakeouts in NIGHT
MOVES, a 1975 movie. Chapter One of the novel by Alan Sharp identifies the
game: "Back to the wall, in danger of defeat, Moritz had a Queen sacrifice
leading to an exquisite mate by means of three little knight moves, prancing
in interlocking checks, driving the king into the pit. In the heat of
something now lost, Moritz had missed it, played defensively and lost."} 1.

{When Reti popularized the hypermodern opening named after him (1. Nf3), he
had some profound positional concepts in mind such as controlling the center
from the wings instead of occupying it with pawns. But when confronted with
such admirable tacticians as Dr. Treybal, the game became as wild as
anything arising out of the King's Gambit.} 1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. g3 c5 4.
Bg2 Nc6 5. O-O Be7 6. Nc3 d5 {Black occupies the center with pawns in a
classical style. Meanwhile, Reti tries to undermine it from the wings, a
typical hypermodern strategy.} 7. cxd5 Nxd5 8. Nxd5 exd5 {Also feasible is
8...Qxd5 to avoid the isolated pawn. If then 9. d3 O-O 10. Be3 Qh5 is

characterizes it today were it not for the hypermoderns. In the 1920s Reti
consistently won high prizes, though he never reached the pinnacle before
his untimely death at age 40. Here is a game of immense historical
importance, which demonstrated the value of his new opening (1.Nf3) against 
one of the oldtimers. Curiously, Reti demolishes Black's pawn center in 
order to occupy it with his own pawns!} 1. Nf3 d5 2. g3 Nf6 3. Bg2 g6 4. c4

{Reti was one of the leaders of the "Hypermodern" movement, a group of
masters who rebelled against the dogmatism of Tarrasch (who claimed that the
center must be occupied by pawns) and demonstrated the power of
counterattack against an immobile center. Here, Reti obtains a fine
strategic position from his opening experiment, but is ensnared by Alekhine
in a whirlwind of combinations. This is an incredibly complicated game where 
everything is suspended in mid-air. Master-magician Alekhine pulls the 
strings, finding one stroke after another, each more powerful than the last,

[Result "1/2"]

{Reuben Fine (1914-1993) was Americas greatest international star in the 
1930s, sharing first with Keres at AVRO 1938 ahead of Alekhine, Botvinnik, 
Capablanca, Euwe, Flohr and Reshevsky (his chief rival on the domestic 
scene). Fans spoke of a "jinx" when referring to Fines inability to convert 
winning positions into a win against "Sammy" or ever to win the U.S. 
Championship. Here Reshevsky again nosed him out for the title by snatching a 
draw from the jaws of defeat.

"Unemployed from 1939 to 1941, Fine saw that a future dedicated to chess was 
bleak at best, and he obeyed the dictates of common sense, returning to 
school in the mid 1940s and earning a psychology doctorate in 1948 from 
U.C.L.A. I believe that in American events, Fine often found himself 
wondering why he was playing chess for pennies and let his mind wander." -- 
Denker and Parr in "The Bobby Fischer I Knew And Other Stories."}

{This event began in 1878 and is probably the longest running ANNUAL event
in the world. The rivalry between America's two leading players was
legendary; here's how Fine himself described this seesaw battle: "Although
we played on a par with the best of that time our own games displayed a
fantastic series of blunders. Either he rescued a lost position against me,
or I did against him. Nor were these subtle mistakes; many of them were so
obvious that the rankest amateur could have seen them. Each wanted to beat
the other, yet unconsciously each was reluctant to do so."} 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4

[Result "1-0"]
[ECO "E03"]

{Going into the last round, Junge led by a half point and needed only a draw
to take first prize. Alekhine launched a far-sighted but risky pawn
sacrifice that paved the way for a spectacular and unexpected rook
sacrifice. This dramatic game was used in "Knight of the Id," a play by
Richard Laurie about Alekhine's last days, when he was shunned by the chess
world as a Nazi collaborator after the war. Speaking of this game, the
fictional Alekhine says: "There is a moment in chess when your opponent
knows he is lost. He knows he can do nothing to save himself. All moves
lose. It is not checkmate. It is before checkmate. Everything he can do is
wrong. There are no good moves. All moves lose. It is a very terrible spot
to be in, but it is fun to watch him squirm. He stares at the board, but it
does not change. Nothing can be changed and there is no hope. He is a mouse
and I am the cat. I watch him very closely as he suffers. When the game is
over, I will feel sympathy for him, but not now. Now I watch him twist and
turn and tear himself to ribbons. His agonies are mine."} 1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6

{Chess flourished in the Soviet Union despite the bloodiest war in its

American teams led by Reshevsky and Fine won gold medals at four straight
Olympiads. The first important sporting event after WWII and one that marked
the beginning of Soviet chess supremacy was a ten board match in September
1945 where moves were transmitted by short wave radio. Each player faced his
opponent twice and the result was totally unexpected. Reshevsky lost both
his games to a future world champion as the USSR crushed the USA 15.5 - 4.5.

{George (Kolty) Koltanowski, the greatest showman and promoter that chess 
ever knew, died at age 96 in 2000. A diamond cutter by trade, he left 
Belgium before the second World War and created a daily chess column that ran 
without interruption for 52 years in The San Francisco Chronicle. Though his 
tournament results were modest, he wrote more than a dozen chess books and 
made headlines in 1937 by taking on 34 opponents at once without sight of the 
board to set a blindfold record with 24 wins and 10 draws. He even took on 
the Chessmaster development team at the age of 94 in five simultaneous games,
easily winning all of them.

He was a tireless exhibitor and raconteur who entertained fans with his 
speciality, the Knights Tour. Spectators posted random words and phone 
numbers in the 64 squares of a giant chessboard. Kolty memorized the 
hodgepodge in seconds and, while blindfolded, called out the path required 
for a knight to touch every square on the board as he recalled these scraps 
of information in order. "I dont know how he does it," said his wife. "He 
cant even remember to bring home a loaf of bread from the supermarket."

"Pawns are like buttons," Kolty often said. "Lose too many and the pants 
fall down by themselves." In his newspaper office he played without sight of 
the board against movie star and chess expert Humphrey Bogart, who lost by a 
mere pawn.}

{On his road to the world championship, Spassky, like his Russian rivals,
honed his talent in strong Soviet championships. Meanwhile, Bronstein, after
tying a title match in 1951, never again reached the heights because he
sought beauty at the expense of practical results. His predilection for
outlandish ideas and eccentric maneuvers produced many memorable games, but
he frequently paid a price for his overflowing imagination. Here, for
example, he goes out on a limb by misplacing his rook on the rim -- an idea
that meets with a drastic refutation.} 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e3

{This crucial last round encounter decided first place. "On move 23 I
offered a draw. Spassky decided that he could without risk continue the
struggle, and perhaps he was right. In any case, it was I who committed the
first mistake after which he seized the initiative. He conducted the middle
game superbly and at adjournment my position gave serious call for alarm.
When the game resumed, I considered that it should finish as a draw. For a
long time I maintained the equilibrium, though it is true I had to find a
number of difficult moves. The strength of one of these was evidently
underestimated by Spassky who by inertia continued playing for a win in a

{Alexander Tolush was one of those players who, though not quite of top
rank, produced an amazing number of brilliant and original games in his
career. In this game, the players attack on opposite wings, and it seems
that Black's attack is quite as strong as White's. But Tolush nonchalantly
sacrifices the exchange to eliminate Black's best attacking piece, and
threads his way through a maze of complications to take that point.} 1. e4

{In the 1960's, the Soviet chess hegemony was threatened first by Bobby
Fischer and then by Danish Grandmaster Bent Larsen. Fischer's disputes with
organizers over playing conditions kept him out of world championship
competition for a decade, but Larsen produced a series of tournament
victories unmatched since Alekhine, including a tie for first with Spassky,
Smyslov and Tal in the 1964 Interzonal. In this game, Bronstein adopts a
very aggressive continuation against the King's Indian Defense, but Larsen
combines defense and counterattack to take the point.} 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3.

{"Opening theory is a strange, speckled animal," observed Bent Larsen.
Indeed, certain variations seem to go in and out of fashion for no apparent
reason. For example, the exchange variation of the Ruy Lopez lost favor for
about 40 years until 1965, when an obscure 41-year-old Dutch professor took
up the cause. The widespread publiclation of this miniature, which he lost,
might have doomed it once again, except it caught Bobby Fischer's eye. A

{"It was clear to me that the vulnerable point of the American grandmaster
was in double-edged, hanging, irrational positions, where he often failed to
find a win even in a won position. This led to my decision to challenge
Fischer in a very sharp game and, what's more, in his favorite variation.
Players who are devoted to certain opening systems know how unpleasant it
can be to play against oneself in the purely psychological sense. To be
objective, it must be pointed out that there is always another side of the 
coin, as was indeed the case here. The opening subleties of the variation 
were well known to Fischer, whereas I had to search very hard for good
continuations in an unfamiliar situation" -- Geller.} 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3.

offer of his h-pawn on move 14, he noted: "I suddenly got this idea and

{Fischers 6-0 victory in this historic match catapulted him on the road to the 
World Championship. In the next match, he also eviscerated Bent Larsen by 6-0 
in the semifinals, and then trounced Petrosian in Buenos Aires to qualify for 
his title match with Spassky at Reykjavik in 1972. "Our third game holds a 
special place in my chess biography. It caused me acute suffering at the time 
and tormented me for many years," noted Taimanov in his book entitled "I Was

to admit, I was seized by the feeling of helplessnes, of despair: 'Is this 
Fischer invulnerable, is he somehow bewitched?' I again returned to 20. Qh3, 
again worked through dozens of variations, and again without success. And 
meanwhile the clock was ticking, time trouble was approaching. According to 
the arbiters' reckoning, I pondered over the position for 72 minutes! Perhaps 
in all the fifty years of my career I have never spent so much time on one

everything lost point, and I made the first move that popped into my head. It

{Fischer now trailed by two points after losing the first game and
forfeiting the second when he refused to show up unless the cameras were
turned off. Spassky, reportedly defying orders to return to Russia, saved
the match by agreeing to play in a private room away from cameras instead of
on stage in front of a full house. "Just this once," he said. "Never again."

he got back home. For the first time ever he lost a game to Fischer and then

remaining forces mutually defended each other," stated the tournament book.

had the satisfaction of creating the craziest game of 1973. An editor asked 
him to annotate the game. "Its impossible!" exclaimed Bronstein. "Neither of

Swiss events ever held in America until then. He also donated a Town Hall to
Inyo County with the proviso that it be available for these chess

seem drab, stodgy and drawish, yet he won numerous brilliancy prizes. This

a6 2. d4 b5 {In the early '80s, the St. George attack (...b7-b5) gained some
popularity when Tony Miles used it to defeat World Champion Karpov. What few
noticed was the huge number of offbeat openings Miles had tried against
Karpov with zero success first. That he eventually scored with one of them
shouldn't be too surprising, and a careful study of that game proved it was
hardly the fault of the opening. However, public taste is seldom based on
good logic, and it took several serious setbacks, including this game,
before the St. George found the obscurity it truly deserves.} 3. Nf3 Bb7 4.

right moment and transposing into a tame line of the Sicilian where the
advanced Queenside pawns may be useful. The position was equal, but Karpov

{By transposition this game reaches the Hedgehog Sicilian, in which White
attempts to keep a bind on the center using the Maroczy-style construction
c4, e4, f3. This is a very effective strategy against the Dragon formations
(Black fianchettos the King Bishop), but active play is harder to develop
versus the flexible and reactive Hedgehog. In this game, the White player
decides to advance the Kingside pawns in a storm, willy-nilly, and is
suitably punished as the Black pieces infiltrate the weaknesses left behind.

{This World Championship game was played in Spain between the two players
who have dominated the Championship since Fischer's refusal to defend it in
1975. Karpov defeated Korchnoi in 1975 (Candidates Finals), 1978, and 1981.
Karpov and Kasparov have played in every match for the title since, until
the odd happenings of this year (1993). Nigel Short qualified to challenge
Kasparov, and together they broke away from FIDE, organizers of the title
match since the death of Alekhine. FIDE countered by replacing them with
Karpov and Timman, who had each lost a match to Short during the
qualification process. This may lead to the odd situation of having both
Kasparov and Karpov claiming the title, although at this point Fischer
himself may have as legitimate a claim as anyone else.} 1. c4 Nf6 2. Nc3 e5

insecure King provide some compensation but the real key to this line is
whether the Bishop on g7 is active. in this game Karpov is so effective at

{Annotations by Yasser Seirawan. A word of warning to the uninitiated. When
you sit down across from Viktor Korchnoi, be prepared to play, because he
will. I've had some real slugfests with Viktor, and just a few draws.} 1. d4
Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. g3 Bb4+ 4. Bd2 Qe7 5. Bg2 Nc6 6. Nf3 Bxd2+ 7. Nbxd2 d6 8.
O-O O-O 9. e4 e5 10. d5 Nb8 11. b4 {With his central wedge, White has the
choice of playing for the Queenside with b2-b4-c4-c5 or the Kingside by
Ne1-d3 and f2-f4. It's rather a matter of taste, but I feel that the
Queenside is the right choice. White's problem is his Bishop. My problem is
that I need to exchange a few pieces to breathe.} 11... a5 {A critical
moment. The alternative was 11...Bg4 and Bxf3, exchanging a pair of minors.
The decision was tough because White's Bishop would take over the vacated
h3-c8 diagonal and keep my Rooks off c8. As a trade of c-pawns is always a
prominent concern in such positions, I delayed the Bishop sally.} 12. a3 Na6
13. Qb3 {White could also consider the immediate 13.Nf3-e1, and b4xa5 might
follow.} 13... c6 14. dxc6 {A shock. It's rare to see Viktor voluntarily
cede the center. His treatment is not so easy to meet. With an eventual Nb3,
he hopes to force me to exchange on b4. He'll then attack d6 and c6 by
either c4-c5, or b4-b5. For my part, if I can relocate my Knight from a6 to
d4, I'll gain a sizable advantage.} 14... bxc6 15. Qc3 Bg4 {A logic glitch.
If I wanted to exchange pieces, I'm late. Instead of wasting time, I should
have played 15...Nc7 (not fearing c4-c5) or 15...Re8 (fearing c4-c5), while
preparing Nc7-e6. In either case the game would be dynamically equal.} 16.
Nh4 {A wonderful, multi-purpose move. It immediately threatens Nf5 when,
after the exchange, White's Bishop will return to life with a vengeance. It
also protects the pawn on e4, thereby freeing the Knight for d2-b3-a5. I now
disappeared into deep thought, well aware of my growing troubles.} 16...
Rfb8 {Lasker said "long think, wrong think." This move helps nothing. Both
16...g6 and 16...Nc7 were better choices.} 17. Rfb1 {Viktor trusts me. He
made this move is response to my rhythm. The threat against b4 is pure
imagination. Being an optimist, I'd rate my game as lousy after 17.Nf5.}
17... Nc7 18. h3 {A hard move to judge, as it facilitates my plan of
...Nc7-e6. My choice is 18.Nb3, when White's play on the Queenside comes too
fast.} 18... Bd7 19. bxa5 {Both Viktor and I love pawns, but what a grub!
This completely destroys the Queenside structure, and gives up c5 to boot.
White's position demands 19.Nf5 with a big edge. Viktor plunges head over
heels into quicksand.} 19... g6 20. Rb6 Ne6 21. Rab1 Rd8 22. Nb3 c5 {The
first indication that things have run afoul. Viktor continues to swim ahead,
believing that the drum beats his tempo. Not so. I'm preparing my
counterblow ...Bd7-a4, in order to gain d4 for one Knight and vacate d7 for
the other. In the post-mortem, Viktor found ways to make the desperate
sortie Nh4-f5 work now and on subsequent moves. Such tactics shouldn't work.
Still, Viktor is right. After 19.bxa5 White's position has become desperate.
} 23. a6 Bc8 24. Qa5 {Viktor plunges deeper into self-made quagmire. The
kicking is soon over. Absolutely forced is 24.Nf5.} 24... Nd7 {Immediately
decisive. Loss of the Exchange is unavoidable. If 25.Rc6, then Bb7 or Nb8;
while if 25.Rb5, then Bxa6.} 25. Nd2 Nxb6 26. Rxb6 Nc7 {The little guy on a6

{Swedish GM Ulf Andersson has a reputation for being one of the hardest
players in the world to beat but Garry Kasparov is equal to the task. The
Exchange Variation of the Queen's Gambit Declined enjoys its popularity in
part to its great flexibility. It can be interpreted as a Queenside middle
game when White castles short and goes for the minority attack (Rab1 and
b2-b4-b5). Or it can be seen as an aggressive attacking scheme when White
goes long and throws his Kingside pawns up. Here Kasparov elects to follow a
third plan - short castling and playing for e3-e4.} 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3.

Re1, h2-h4, Rh3, and Ng5. It's hard to believe that Black should have
difficulties equalizing, but where to put the King? Going Kingside walks

require a number of tempi.} 14... Nd7 15. Re1 Rae8 16. d5 {Is this really

gums up Black's pieces. Also, it really leaves Black in a quandary

{Russian GM Andrei Sokolov stunned the chess world when he reached the
Candidates final in 1987. He hasn't been able to repeat that success but he
does hold the distinction of being one of the few players in the world to
have beaten both Kasparov and Karpov. This game however is not one of his
more golden moments. Kasparov plays a very sharp pawn sacrifice and Sokolov,
who is better noted for his attacking play rather than defensive prowess,
quickly goes down.} 1. c4 Nf6 2. Nc3 e6 3. e4 {The text, which keeps the
game going along pure English lines and sidesteps the Nimzo-Indian (3.d4
Bb4), is perfect for Kasparov's aggressive style.} 3... c5 {A more
circumspect choice was 3...d5 aiming for 4.e5 d4 5.exf6 dxc3 6.bxc3 Qxf6
7.d4 e5. The text offers White a chance to play a very promising gambit.} 4.

Bishops, a lead in development, and lots of play on the dark squares.} 11...

game 18.c5 had been tried and found wanting. With the text White prepares to
lock in Black's Bishop and in so doing his Rook on a8 as well.} 18... Nfd4
19. Nd5 Qf7 20. f5 g6 21. Rg1 {Grandmaster Sergey Makarichev, one of
Kasparov's coaches, gave this move two exclamation marks in Chess Informant
45. Why? Partly because 21.Qxd6 is messy but also because the text will open
lots of lines which should favor the better developed player - White.} 21...
gxf5 22. g5 Kh8 23. gxf6 Be6 24. Qxd6 Bxd5 25. cxd5 Qxf6 {This move seems
like it loses a piece but Sokolov has seen a trick a few moves down the
road. Unfortunately for him Kasparov's evaluation of the position has gone
much deeper. He foresees that despite being temporarily a pawn down in the
ending he has all the winning chances thanks to his two Bishops.} 26. Qxf6+

that was mutual. I had 5 minutes left until move 40 while Garry had 6
minutes left. Unfortunately, my confidence was not fully warranted. White's
Knights on c3 and e2 step on each other's hooves. My Queen is passive. And
the f3-pawn can easily be undermined by h4-h3. Both players were beginning
to tense up. I felt my mind had slipped into high gear and was speeding at

White.} 7. Qe3+ Qe7 8. Qxe7+ Kxe7 9. b3 {A powerful move that Nigel had
missed when allowing the exchange of Queens. The move has several points. It
protects c4, making counterplay based on ...Bc8-e6 impossible. Also, when
Black plays ...c7-c6, protecting d5 and neutralizing the Bishop on g2, White
then can play Bc1-a3 pressing against d6. Black has a bleak future. He'll
have to sit passively, waiting to counterpunch. The question is, what is the
best defensive arrangement for Black's pieces? Should he forgo playing
...c7-c6 and play ...a7-a5 with ...Nb8-a6 in mind? Or should he bite the
bullet, play 9...Rd8 intending ...c7-c6, ...Bc8-e6, ...Nb8-d7-b6, and
...d6-d5? The choice is not an easy one even with hindsight.} 9... a5 {Nigel
didn't like this move and blamed it for his problems in this game. He felt
9...Rd8 aiming for an eventual ...d6-d5 was better.} 10. Bb2 c6 11. Na4 {A
very strong move. Black is sentenced to keep watch over the b6 square while
his Kingside his kingside is paralyzed on the a1-h8 diagonal. White already
has a significant advantage. It's moves like this -moving the same piece
twice, decentralizing the Knight, etc. - that gives chess teachers
nightmares.} 11... Be6 {It's hard to question a move like this, but Black's
position craves exchanges. Better is 11...Nh5 or 11...Ne8 intending to
exchange Bishops and use e6 for the Knight. This would have relieved some of
the pressure on Black's position. With the benefit of hindsight, it's plain
that Black had to be willing to make a major concession to trade these
Bishops.} 12. Nf3 Nbd7 {Nigel is drifting. In combination with ...a7-a5,
this method of development is not logical.} 13. Nd4 {Now all of White's

can resign.} 13... Rhc8 14. O-O Rab8 15. Rac1 {Garry is wrong to discourage
...b7-b5. After the indicated 15.Rfd1, followed by Rd2, Black is history. If
15...b5?!, then 16.cxb5 cxb5 17.Nc3 b4 and 18.Ncb5, intending Na7, and the
game would end before it had properly begun.} 15... Ne8 16. Rfd1 {The
handwriting is on the wall. Black has to hold his breath and play some ugly
moves before things get any worse.} 16... c5 {The best move, but I can't
bring myself to give such a move an exclamation mark! Review my earlier
notes.} 17. Nb5 Bxb2 18. Nxb2 Nb6 19. Nc3 Na8 {The Knight on b6 is a dead

...b7-b6, after which material losses will become unavoidable.} 23. Nac3 Bc6
24. Rcd1 Rd8 {White has achieved all he can on the queenside and in the
center, and it's not enough to win the game. How to step up the pressure?
It's clear that the Kingside has to get involved. The winning idea will be
to play e2-e3, f2-f4, g3-g4-g5 and then to push the h-pawn. Garry now sets
this plan in motion.} 25. g4 {Black isn't given the chance to exchange

...Nxa2. I now went into a "long think, wrong think" routine. White wants to
move the Bishop on g5 and play g4-g5.} 17. Bh4 {Understandable but wrong.

defensive stroke.} 19... Re8 {This move goes to the very heart of the
position. Black will allow White to sacrifice an Exchange only on his own
terms. White must occupy g5 with a pawn, and in the meantime Black simply
protects e7. After having launched myself into the position, I felt as if I
had stepped into a cold shower. Black still has his Queenside pressure while
White's attack is chimerical.} 20. Bd1 Ne4 21. Qe3 Nxc3 22. Bxb3 Bd4 23.

{The official world of international chess has long been divided into the
men's half (95%+) and the women's half (5%-), with tournaments exclusively
for women and events that attracted only men, although they were in theory
open to all. This was not entirely bad for the women players, because in
truth none was good enough to compete with the best male players. All this
began to change in the 1980s, however, and now there are a few women players
who choose to play almost exclusively with the men. Most of these are the
Polgar sisters, but in this game we see one of the brave non-Polgars,
Sweden's Pia Cramling, in a losing effort against Israeli GM Lev Psakhis.}

{Annotations by Yasser Seirawan. This was my first game with the world's
fourth-highest-rated played. I looked forward to the opportunity to test
him; but as the game got underway I began to feel nervous. Ivanchuk is a
shy, reserved young man who has several distracting habits at the board. For
instance, he rarely looks at the board. Usually, he looks directly up in the
air, or at the space behind your head. I began to wonder what was going to
fall down on me - or sneak up on me!} 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 c5 3. d5 e5 {I
sometimes enjoy playing this closed Benoni variation because it leads to
rich strategical positions. I wanted to steer my opponent as far away as
possible from a sharp theoretical struggle. This didn't prevent Ivanchuk
from playing the most topical line.} 4. Nc3 d6 5. e4 Be7 6. h3 O-O 7. Nf3
Nbd7 8. g4 {The Kingside expansion is crucial for White in this variation.
Black's plan is ...Nf6-e8, ...g7-g6, ...Ne8-g7, and ...f7-f5. By employing a
King's Indian Defense attacking motif, Black's position takes on a lot of
the advantages of that opening with fewer drawbacks than usual. Black has
stopped White's play on the Queenside with c7-c5. Also, Black's "bad" Bishop
on e7 is actually on the right square. Black often plays ...Bg7-f8 or
...bg7-h6 in K.I.D. positions. From e7 the Bishop, if allowed, will play to
g5 - or to d8 and a5.} 8... Ne8 9. Bd3 g6 10. Be3 {It's common for White to
play 10.Bh6 Ng7 11.Rg1, etc. In this case, Black usually plays ...Kg8-h8 and
...Nd7-f6-g8 chasing away White's Bishop on h6. This works out nicely for
Black because his King is no longer on the g-file. Therefore, 10.Be3 is more
exact.} 10... Ng7 11. Rg1 Nf6 12. Qe2 h5 {An interesting attempt to force a
resolution of the kingside situation. I had become disenchanted with the
idea of forcing ...f7-f5 through. This loss of resolve, however, constituted
a severe psychological problem. Because of my attempt to avoid the basic
confrontation in the position, White gains a clear advantage. Best was
13...Nfe8!.} 13. Nd2 Qd7 {The only way to justify the eccentric ...h7-h5.
Still the move took a long time: my mind went swimming in a stream of
tactical complications.} 14. f3 {Played without hesitation. This left me
cursing all the time I had wasted on 13...Qd7. The drawbacks of f2-f3 are
clear. White weakens a whole complex of dark squares on the Kingside. Also,
the Knight can't return to f3, and White's Queen no longer hits h5. This
allows Black good play on the dark squares. Better is 14.Bc2!.} 14... Nh7
15. O-O-O Bg5 {By trading dark-squared Bishops, Black solves his strategic
problems.} 16. Bxg5 Nxg5 17. Qg2 Qe7 18. h4 Nh7 19. Qg3 {The critical moment
in the game. My approach to this position was quite lazy. I was satisfied
with myself for "outplaying" my opponent through exchanging Bishops.
Clearly, White's only chance in the position is g4-g5 and f3-f4. In this
case, I reasoned that the Kingside would become closed, and that I would get
two key squares: g4 and e5. So, without further ado, I played the
"obvious"...} 19... a6 {...essentially losing the game. Obviously Black
wants to play b7-b5 - but who does this favor? Look at that lousy Knight on
d2. Let it jump to c4, however, and it becomes an entire cavalry. No, it is
still correct to play defensively, completely killing White's only play in
the position (g4-g5 and f3-f4) with 19...Nf6! 20.g5 Nd7 when it's clear that
the first player is going nowhere on the Kingside. Black can then prepare a
Queenside advance: ...Ng7-e8-c7 and ...a7-a6.} 20. g5 {I was now horrified
to discover that both my Knights had been cut out of the action. White
intends Rdf1, f3-f4, and Nd2-f3. If White gains control of the e4-sqaure,
the game is over.} 20... f6 {A panicky reaction to what I felt was my
impending doom. Black can still fight with 20...Re8. Now, though, I open up
the position in the worst possible way.} 21. gxf6 Rxf6 22. Rdf1 Bd7 23. f4

{In the split match for the World Championship in 1990, the scene changed
from New York to Lyon, France. But the scene on the chessboard stayed much
the same, with the contestants essaying the King's Indian Defense when
Karpov was White, and the Ruy Lopez when Kasparov played the White pieces.
Some variety occurred late in the match, but most of the time the chess
world was treated to, or forced to endure, depending on your orientation, a
seemingly endless series of similar lines. This is one of the games that
Kasparov won brilliantly - and when this occurred, even the critics found
time to wonder.} 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Be7 6. Re1

the match, some wondered if the Ruy - one of the world's oldest openings -
wasn't advantageous to Black! Karpov's match with Hjartarson in Seattle
certainly left that impression. Kasparov quickly dispelled the notion,
making a theoretical improvement the first time the line was played in this
match, and winning nicely. Karpov improved in turn, but although he got big
advantages in several games, he failed to make the most of his chances.} 11.

the first, Karpov missed a fairly easy win of a pawn, and the game was
drawn. Now Kasparov came through with a major theoretical improvement
against Karpov's Zaitzev Ruy Lopez, and after a controversial combination,
Garry crashed through. At this point, it looked like Kasparov's prediction -
that he would crush GM Karpov and prove he was unquestionably the greatest
player in the world - might just come true. Karpov managed to come back,
though, and once again the two titans played a remarkably close match.} 1.

White maintains some of the tension in the center, but doesn't put the

White a very small but fairly persistent advantage.} 3... Nc6 {Black's main
choices are 3...c5, 3...Nf6, and 3...Nc6, although many other moves have
some validity. After the move chosen, Black will have to move the Knight
again to allow ...c7-c5, and then will probably return it to the natural c6
square. But since the position will remain closed (after e4-e5) this loss of
time may not be too serious.} 4. Ngf3 Nf6 5. e5 Nd7 6. Bb5 {Since White
doesn't really intend to capture at c6, which would leave Black the

Rook, and pieces for both sides will need to be shifted several times to
find the right homes. Considering Black's Queenside space advantage, it is
possible he already stands better.} 12. Nf1 Be7 13. Ng3 h5 14. Ne2 Nb6 15.

{Annotations by Yasser Seirawan. It's always a good idea to make sure none
of one's favorite lines have been busted and before this game I quickly
scanned the games in New In Chess Yearbook 15. Sure enough, right on cue, GM
Khalifman had just clobbered someone who played my favorite variation of the
Rat Defense. Rats! He had annotated the game, and had gone so far as to give
my 8...fxe6 a ?! mark. The cheek! His notes were short and succinct. Was it
the end of my idea? I refused to believe it, and spent a whole night and
early morning mulling the variation over. I hoped things were patched up
successfully because my next opponent was the dangerous GM John van der
Wiel.} 1. e4 d6 2. d4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 {I prefer this move order to that of the
classical Pirc (2...Nf6) because I consider it more flexible. In the
variation where White plays Bc1-e3 and Qd1-d2, angling for Be3-h6, it's
sometimes useful to have a Knight on g8.} 4. f4 Nf6 5. Nf3 c5 6. Bb5+ Bd7 7.
e5 Ng4 8. e6 fxe6 9. Ng5 Bxb5 10. Nxb5 Qa5+ 11. c3 Qxb5 12. Qxg4 cxd4 13.
Nxe6 {This position was evaluated as winning for White by Khalifman. As we
had both played quickly up to now, I immediately played my novelty.} 13...
Qc4 {After making this move, I got up to get a glass of mineral water. While
at the refreshment stand, I heard the other players joking, "How can this
guy be leading the tournament? he leaves his pieces hanging with check!"
After a pause, John found his only chance for an advantage.} 14. Nxg7+ Kf7
15. Nf5 {Avoiding Black's trap. On 15.Nh5? dxc3! (threatening...Qc4-e4+ and
...g6x h5) 16.Ng3 cxb2 17.Bxb2 Qb4+, Black safely recovers his piece with
the better game.} 15... Qe6+ 16. Ne3 dxe3 17. f5 {In my preparations I had
decided that this was the only way for White to attain an advantage. Of
course, 17.Qxe6+ Kxe6 18.Bxe3 Nc6 is completely equal.} 17... gxf5 18. O-O
Nc6 {The try 18...Nd7 19.Rxf5+ Nf6 seemed equally plausible. After a lot of
late-night deliberations, I preferred the text because of the game
continuation. It seemed to me that Black's King was quite safe on d7 with a
Knight protecting e7. The open files on the Kingside guarantee Black
adequate counterplay.} 19. Rxf5+ Ke8 20. Rf8+ {White is thinking along
classical lines only and mistakenly plays into an ending where he believes
he stands better because he has a Bishop versus a Knight and Black has three
pawn islands to White's two. But for White to retain any real threats he had
to keep the Queens on the board. Better is 20.Qf3!.} 20... Kd7 21. Qxe6+
Kxe6 22. Rxa8 Rxa8 23. Bxe3 Rf8 24. Re1 {Losing a tempo. The game is quickly
drawn after 24.Rf1!. I was happy to see John trying to win this ending as my
next move proves that it is Black who has the pull.} 24... Kd5 25. Bg5 {
Another wasted tempo. Again 25.Rf1 is correct.} 25... e5 26. Rd1+ Ke6 27.
Rd3 {When I saw this move, I realized that John was oblivious to the danger.
He is trying to play without his Queenside majority and without his King!
Black is well ahead in the race already. Time to drive the point home.}
27... d5 28. Rh3 {White consistently carries out his mistaken plan. White's
Rook on h3 is apparently active, but the Black Rook on f7 does more - it
cuts off White's King.} 28... Rf7 29. Bd2 d4 {Now White began to sense the
danger. Black is ready to transfer his King to e4, dominating White's Rook
along the third rank.} 30. Rf3 Rd7 {After White finally discovers that his
Rook belongs on the f-file, Black refuses the exchange. My center pawns are
lusting to advance further.} 31. cxd4 exd4 {A difficult move to sort out.
Both ...Rxd4 and ...Nxd4 appear to be better, but this isn't the case. After
31...exd4, Black's Rook is nicely placed behind the passed pawn. The
e5-square becomes available for the Knight - which may transfer to c4 -
while the d-pawn itself is one square further advanced.} 32. b3 Ne5 33. Rf4
Ng6 34. Rg4 {White is worried about the possible transfer of the Black Rook
to the c-file. But the White Rook is poorly placed here. I had expected
34.Rf1 when, despite the best efforts of both White and Black, the position
is only slightly better for Black.} 34... Kd5 {Freeing the Rook.} 35. Kf1 {
Just in time. White activates the King in preparation for 35...Rc7 36.Ke2
Rc2 37.Kd3 and the game is equal.} 35... Rf7+ 36. Ke1 Ne5 37. Rh4 Rg7 38.
Kf2 b6 39. Bf4 {An interesting practical decision. Black is offered a Rook
and pawn ending with an extra unit, but the extra h-pawn isn't fantastic.
Still, White has problems.} 39... Nd3+ 40. Ke2 Nxf4+ 41. Rxf4 Rxg2+ 42. Kd3
Rxh2 43. Rxd4+ Ke6 {The only winning chance Black has in this ending is to
place his Rook behind his h-pawn, h7 being the ideal square. Then Black has
but a single weakness on the Queenside (a7) which he protects with the Rook.
Black has to use his King to keep White's Rook from penetrating to the
eighth and harassing Black's Queenside. Karpov said the ending was a draw -
but both sides have their problems.} 44. a4 Rh5 {With the transparent threat
of ...Rh5-d5. On a deeper level, Black plans ...Rh5-d5+ - d7 and switching
behind the h-pawn.} 45. Rg4 Kf7 {Black brings his King to the Kingside in
order to assist the h-pawn's touchdown.} 46. b4 {A probable error. White had
to use this moment to penetrate with his Rook: 46.Rf4+ Kg6 47.Rf8.} 46...
Re5 47. Kd4 Re6 48. Kd5 h5 49. Rh4 Rh6 {This is the cruncher. The passive
White Rook makes the rest look easy.} 50. Ke5 Kg6 51. Kf4 Kf6 {Zugzwang!
White must retreat. Now White intends to blockade with his King. This leaves
the White Queenside easy pickings.} 52. Kg3 Ke5 53. Kh3 a6 54. Rc4 Kd5 55.
Rc8 Rc6 56. Ra8 b5 57. axb5 axb5 58. Ra1 Rc4 {White Resigns. If 59.Rb1, then 
...Rd4 with the unstoppable threat ...Kc4-c3 and ...Rd5xd4.} 0-1

{This game was played at the annual chess festival in Biel, Switzerland.
Russian Grandmaster Smagin used a startling Queen sacrifice, catapulting him
to victory over his Yugoslav colleague.} 1. e4 Nc6 2. d4 d5 3. e5 Bf5 4. c3
e6 5. Nd2 f6 {Black attacks the head of the pawn chain, rather than
preparing the positionally superior ...c5, which has the drawback of costing
too much time. Another plan for Black is to blockade the light squares with
h5, g6, and Nh6. This would be risky unless the Bishop f5 can be exchanged,
so it is normally played only if White has provided a Knight on f3 that can
be pinned. It is also stronger if White has committed his f-pawn to f4,
since from f3 it can support the blockade-busting move g2-g4.} 6. f4 {Now
that Black has chosen to play ...f6, this move is desirable.} 6... fxe5 7.
fxe5 Nh6 8. Ndf3 Nf7 9. Ne2 Be7 10. Ng3 Bg4 {This work's out badly. Better
was 10...Bh4 pinning the g3-Knight.} 11. Bd3 Ng5 12. Nxg5 {A spectacular
move. White sacrifices his Queen for two minor pieces and a dangerous
attack. Black is forced to accept the Trojan offer.} 12... Bxd1 13. Nxe6 Qb8
14. Nxg7+ Kd8 {The first critical moment. Black must chose between this
defense and the more testing: 14.Kf7 Bh6 15.Bf8 16.O-O Kg8 17.N7f5 Bg4
18.Rf4! Bf5 19.Bxf5 Nd8 20.Be4 Bxh6 21.Bxd5+ Kg7 22.Nh5+ Kg6 23.Rf6+ Kxh5
24.Bf3+ Kg5 25.g3 - a ;remarkable variation given by Smagin which
demonstrates the dangers Black faces.} 15. Kxd1 {White has two minor pieces
and two pawns for his sacrificed Queen. More important, though, is that
Black's "extra" Queen is neatly buried on the Queenside. The rest of the
game is a struggle between keeping the Queen entombed or reviving her.}
15... b5 16. Ne6+ Kc8 17. Nf5 Bf8 {A poor choice. Black should have tried
17...Qb6 18.Nf4 Rd8 19.Ne3 when White is for choice, but it is still a
fight. Black didn't want to put his Queen into a possible Knight fork.} 18.

A mistake. This move took Karpov about a quarter of an hour. Obviously Black
is concerned about the position of his King, so he prepares a home for him
on c7. The problem is that by playing this move now., Black throws his
timing off and allows White a strong attack. After 6...Be6! 7.b3 Nd7, White
has a slight advantage.} 7. f4 {Only this move exposes the vulnerability of
Black's position. White wants to open the center and deny Black's King the
c7-square. It is also a prelude to a long and complex pawn sacrifice.} 7...
Be6 8. Nf3 Bxc4 9. Bh3 f5 10. b3 {This goes to the very heart of the
position. The key question facing White is: "What are you going to do with
the Bishop on c1?" Is it going to g5 with check? That is attractive to be
sure, but it implies f4xe5 which involves a large tempo loss. Beside,
doesn't the Knight want to go to e5? So that leaves Bc1-e3. Hardly
inspiring.} 10... Bb4 {Karpov finds the only defense! But when in his career
has it happened that after 10 moves he has only 27 minutes left for the last
30 moves of time control?} 11. Bb2 Bd5 12. e4 {Fantastic! I'm fighting for
the initiative at all costs. Somehow White has managed to develop all his
minors and play c4,d4,e4, and f4 while Black has only managed to move his
Bishops, pawns and put his King on a bad square!} 12... fxe4 {The only move.
} 13. O-O-O Bxc3 {Excellent. Black finds the only chance: sacrifice an
Exchange! A cursory glance shows he had no choice. If 13...Nf6? then 14.Ng5!
(again not Nf3xe5), and Black is about to be slam-dunked.} 14. Bxc3 exf3 15.
Bxe5 Nd7 16. Bxh8 Ne7 {Up to this point, the moves of the game have been
incredibly complex and have taken a considerable toll on both player's
clocks. I had foreseen this position when playing 12.e4 and had thought,
"Okay, Black has a pawn for the Exchange." But I reasoned that Black's
little fella on f3 was too far from the supply lines, and that after a few
deft moves the game would be over. So I nonchalantly made a lazy piece of
analysis and played a mistake.} 17. Rhf1 {Rooks belong on open files!

pawn majority is being clamped down. Since White is unable to take action on
the Queenside without creating a weakness, Black will use his majority on
the Kingside for an easy strategical win. White must avoid the above
structure, and the simplest way is with 9.e4.} 9... d4 {At last!} 10. Na4 b6
11. g4 {Black is ideally placed for ...Qd8-c7, ...bc8-b7 and ...e7-e5 when
the handwriting is on the wall. White has an offside Knight on a4 and no
clear line of play. With the text, White regains some control of his
e3-square and tries to challenge in the center.} 11... Nd6 12. h3 Bb7 13. e4
{White is forced to allow Black his strategical aims. Why? Because Black has
more space. By mobilizing his pieces behind his pawn wedge, Black can build
a menacing position. White needs some space before his is pushed off the
board.} 13... dxe3ep 14. Bxe3 Qd7 15. Nc3 f5 16. g5 {Black is in his
strategic glory. His remaining goal is to win complete mastery of the
d4-square for a minor piece. Once this is done, White will be forced to play
c2-c3 when Black will swarm over the resulting weaknesses. This means
getting rid of the White Knight on f3 - preferably not in exchange for the
Black Knight on c6 as he is ticketed for d4 - combined with the idea of
utilizing my Kingside majority. The next series of moves is easy to see.}

Qd2-g2 when Black's domination of d4 is hindered.} 21. Bf4 Rxe1 22. Rxe1 Nd4
{Mission accomplished. Black has a protected passed pawn on the Kingside,
which becomes more important as the minor pieces get exchanged. At the
moment, White's immediate problem is how to cope with the beast on d4. He
decides to sacrifice a pawn for activity.} 23. Bxb7 Qxb7+ 24. Qg2 Qxg2+ 25.
Kxg2 Nxc2 26. Re7 Rf7 27. Re6 Rf8 28. Re7 Rd8 {This move is a hallmark of
Karpov's. He is fantastic at limiting his opponent's pieces while maximizing
his own after he has achieved his strategic aims. In this situation White's
Rook has been allowed to penetrate, but Black keeps White's Knight on c3
nicely bottled up. It mustn't be allowed the trip Nc3-d5-f6+. In the
meantime, the pawn on d3 is about to be slurped.} 29. Rxa7 Ne1+ 30. Kf1 Nxd3

his Knight, while Black's f5-pawn is waiting for his role.} 31. Bc7 Rd7 32.
Na4 {In time trouble, White chucks the game away. Obviously Black's play to
limit the Knights mobility had made a strong impression on White's psyche.
This attempt at mobilizing the Knight is really no choice at all. Black's
pieces just work better. Probably the best line for White was 32.Bxb6 Rxa7

win, as Black's pieces are all ideally placed. I'm also a pawn up and have a
mating attack. Great. Now, stop for a moment and see if you can find the
win. At first the idea of ...Nd3-e1+ and ...Bd4-f2+ seems very appealing. Or
perhaps the simple ...Rd4-f2+ and ...f5-f4-f3. Hmmm, not so simple. After
staring at the board for a long time, I finally found the right idea, a
really strange Knight move - away from the action!} 43... Rf2+ 44. Kg3 Nc1

{Even when played by two of the greatest players alive, the King's Indian
Defense is a game of opposite wing attacks, decided in favor of the player
whose attack is the more efficiently planned - or more likely against the
player who wastes time. Kasparov is the world's foremost expert on the
dynamic Black side of this defense.} 1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6

possibility is 9.Nd2, planning to put the Knight on c4 to pressure d6 after
a general advance on that wing. The move played intends Nd3 and c5, when the

to defend the King, usually from f2.} 9... Nd7 10. Be3 f5 11. f3 f4 12. Bf2

pieces about to clear lines, defend Queenside squares (d6 and c7 are key),
and attack the King. Knight routes like Ng8-f6-d7-f6-e8 are common, while
the other steed can be seen on the Nb8-c6-e7-g6-h4 highway. Black's
attacking chances should not be underestimated.} 13. a4 {There are lines in
which this move can play an important part, but there doesn't seem to be any
hurry about playing it. Better is 13.Nd3 followed by c4-c5, c5xd6, Ra1-c1,

Kingside tempo.} 13... Ng6 14. Nd3 Nf6 15. c5 h5 16. h3 Rf7 {An important
move, giving Black options to use the Rook on the g- or h- files while
defending c7 along the rank and allowing the Bishop to defend d6 from f8 if
necessary.} 17. c6 {White still does better to capture on d6, transferring
the base of the pawn chain. The move chosen costs too much time, and Black's
attack breaks through.} 17... a5 {Slowing down the occupation of c6 by the
Knight (d3-b4-c6) and winning a tempo. Perhaps this excellent defense is
what Korchnoi overlooked; it is often a bad idea to make defensive pawn
moves on the side of the board that is being attacked by the opponent.} 18.

Artur was determined not to allow White's pieces to get back.} 24. gxh4 Qxh4
{The crucial moment. I thought that Black's attack could now be repulsed by
25.Nce7+!, grabbing the Bishop on f5. Ivanchuk thought for several minutes,
hesitated, reached out his hand, and grabbed the wrong Knight! Now, holding
the wrong Knight, Ivanchuk looked grieved, then continued as if nothing was
wrong. How can the world's number two player grab the wrong piece? My guess
is nerves.} 25. Nde7+ {A gross error. The Knight on d5 was fulfilling a
brilliant function, it hit the kids on f4 and e3 and it was just a hop from
the kingside, whereas the Knight on c6 is obviously useless.} 25... Kh8 26.

Of course, this is the only way to test Black's opening setup. After d5xc4,
if White doesn't use his central majority, then Black gets fine queenside
play.} 11... e5 12. Rd1 {Awaiting developments while reinforcing the center.
Clearly the d-file will be opened and the Rook is well-positioned on d1.
Black's ...a7-a6 has committed him to queenside play, thus the roles are
clear. White will play in the center, Black on the queenside. The following
moves are consequential for both players.} 12... b5 13. Bf1 c5 14. d5 c4 {

Rook's retreat on a5 is cut off, it will happily roost on a7. A Knight on c5
would be formidably placed, so White ensures its exchange.} 18... Qd8 19.

Black's problems.} 20... Nc5 21. Nxc5 Bxc5 22. Ra1 {Both players have been
on a collision course to this position. Anand has put his faith in his
far-flung queenside pawns, Karpov in his center. The outcome is more than
just a matter of victory or defeat in one game. The result will test the
mettle of Black's entire opening strategy!} 22... c3 23. Nxe5 c2 {It's not

extremely menacing. So despite Black's queenside gains, White is for choice.
} 24. Rd3 {Well played. From this perch, the Rook supports the d-pawn, eyes
the b3-pawn, and has the potential for a kingside shift. White's problem is
his vulnerable e4-pawn, Black has to be quick with his tactical shots, else
defeat is assured. White's principal threat is Ne5-c6.} 24... Qe8 {This
simply fails. Better is 24...Bd7.} 25. Nc6 Rb6 26. Be3 Nxe4 {Black is forced

{For many years the British struggled to create even one Grandmaster, and
now they can boast at least a half-dozen. Whether this is due to the success
of some great plan, is the result of an increase in the game's popularity,
or is just blind luck is uncertain. Nigel Short is the first English player
to challenge for the World Championship since the days of Howard Staunton in
the mid 1800's. In this game, though, he falls victim to another strong
Brit, the inventive Jonathan Speelman.} 1. d4 e6 2. c4 f5 {The Dutch Defense
has often been considered to be unsound at the highest levels. The reason
Black chooses to play ...e7-e6 before ...f7-f5 is to avoid some nasty gambit
lines - one of which even dates back to and is named after Staunton. 1.d4 f5
2.e4 is the Staunton Gambit, and it is a weapon that is still feared by
players of the Dutch. Short also wouldn't mind a transposition to the French
(1.d4 e6 2.e4), as he is an acknowledged expert in the opening.} 3. g3 Nf6

necessity and try to begin a Kingside attack involving this theme.} 6. O-O

Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 Ne7 {A slightly unusual move for Predrag. He often times side
steps the Winawer pawn sacrifice (7.Qg4) by playing 6...Qc7 anticipating
7.Qg4 f6 with a different middlegame plan. Of course White can play 7.Nf3
reverting back to main lines where Black has committed himself to ...Qd8-c7,
thereby losing several options.} 7. Nf3 {John is rightly regarded as one of
the world's foremost theoreticians and practitioners of 1.e4. he can be
counted upon to challenge the sharpest lines. Interestingly, he eschews the
debate over 7.Qg4.} 7... b6 {The text is a favorite of Nikolic. Black plays
for the exchange of his problem Bishop (...Bc8-a6).} 8. Bb5+ Bd7 9. Bd3 {
Strategically, a very sharp decision. White permits ...Bd7-a4 which hampers
the development of White's queenside (a3-a4, Bc1-a3). More common is 9.a4
with a strategically complex game.} 9... Ba4 {Accepting the perch to roost.}
10. dxc5 {An ugly move. White wants to insure that the game is opened for
his two Bishops. The move implies the sacrifice of the e5-pawn.} 10... bxc5
11. O-O c4 12. Be2 Ng6 {According to Nikolic, this reasonable looking move
is his only mistake of the game! It took 23 flawless moves by White to
demonstrate why the move was bad! I suppose Nikolic missed something in his
calculations! Essentially, White has already sacrificed his game
positionally. He is banking on an attack based on Nf3-d4/g5, f2-f4-f5. From
this perspective Black should be developing pieces towards a defense. Thus
12...Nd7 or 12...Qa5, playing for ...Qa5xc3, ...Ba4xc2 defending the
kingside are preferable.} 13. Ng5 {A forced and powerful pawn sacrifice.
Black must accept the gift, as otherwise f2-f4-f5 is a free attack.} 13...
Nxe5 {Not 13...h6? 14.Nxe6 fxe6 15.Bh5 winning a pawn.} 14. f4 Nd3 {In
general, when defending it is a good idea to exchange pieces. This move has
the unfortunate drawback of allowing White to play Qd1-h5 in one move.} 15.
Bxd3 cxd3 16. f5 e5 17. Qh5 {And this is the rub. Black's King is now
trapped in the center. Surprisingly both players now embark on a forced line
in which White must sacrifice a piece.} 17... Qe7 {The best. After 17...Qb6+
18.Kh1 g6 19.Qh6 is a smash. Black is close to consolidating, but it is
White's move.} 18. Ne6 Kd7 {A sad reality. After 18...g6 19.fxg6 fxe6 20.g7+
or 19...fxg6 20.Qxe5 is a clobber. Meanwhile, White threatens Bc1-g5
developing with tempo. Black prepares to meet this with ...f7-f6.} 19. Bg5
f6 20. Be3 {Around this time, White has to be satisfied with the idea of
10.dxc5 opening up the b-file.} 20... Na6 21. cxd3 g6 {The most testing. If
Black doesn't try to undermine the Knight on e6 he may as well resign.} 22.
Qg4 Bc6 23. Nd4 {A wonderfully intuitive piece sacrifice. Neither player was
able to calculate all the lines. Black is forced to go for the ride, while
White felt that Black's exposed King and disorganized pieces were
sufficient. Certainly, in practice, White's role is easier.} 23... exd4 24.
Bxd4 h5 25. Qh3 g5 26. Rfe1 Qf8 27. Re6 Rh6 28. Qe3 {A powerful move. White
prevents ...Na6-c7 because Bd4-c5 wins the d6-square. Besides controlling
the e-file, the a7-pawn is also given attention.} 28... Re8 29. Re1 Nc7 30.
Bc5 Qf7 31. Be7 {Only this move justifies White's attack. Black threatened
to simply waltz away with his King. Now 31...Kc8? leaves the Bishop en
prise. White threatens Re6-d6xc6.} 31... Rh7 32. Qc5 Bb7 33. Qxa7 {Killing.

{The opening stages of chess games carry names, and frequently beginners put
too much faith in these names. A not-uncommon tendency at the lower levels
is to ignore the opponent's play. One quote: "I played the King's Gambit
against the Sicilian." For more experienced players this is humorous, but
every player has experienced dramatic transpositions in the opening. This
game begins as an English, but transposes into the Sicilian on move nine.}

English player won with some nifty tactics in the transitional stages of the

Traditional Nimzowitschian strategy against the isolated pawn is to first
blockade it, then surround and destroy it. Black acts quickly to prevent the
physical blockade of the pawn, advancing it as a gambit to win the Bishop
pair and hopefully inconvenience the White King.} 14. Bxc6+ bxc6 15. Bxd4

Exchange and two Pawns, which would normally be more than a match for the
Bishop pair. But Black will soon win the Bishop on h8, and then will have
two Bishops for the Rook and Pawns. As can be seen in many of these games,
King safety plays a major role in the evaluation of the position, and soon
Speelman heads into an endgame where tactics again predominate.} 20... Kf7

starting position might have to be changed before each game. "I think we're
coming to the end of the history of chess with the present rules," he said
with regret. "We have to get away from the game becoming simply a question
of memorization." Going into this encounter Spassky led by a point and while
it was in progress IBM's Deep Thought pointed out where he missed several
chances to increase his lead. From now on machines would play a dominant

{Played at the Festival in Biel, Switzerland, in 1992. Kiril Georgiev seems
to shine especially against Shirov - for Georgiev, Shirov is a "good

choosing one way over the other have to do with minor sub-variations that
are possible in each line: the shorter route allows White to choose 7.Nd5
instead, which some wish to avoid; the longer version doesn't really force
Nd4-b5.} 9... Be6 {Black usually plays 9...b5 to prevent White from bringing
his Knight back into the game via c4. Then White might play Nd5, c3, Nc2,

try to take immediate advantage of the weaknesses Black has created by all
of these pawn moves.} 10. Nc4 Rc8 11. Bxf6 gxf6 12. Ne3 Bh6 13. Bd3 Bxe3 {

{Chess fans were giddy when the reclusive American, now 49, made a comeback.
He showed up in war-torn Yugoslavia to play his first tournament game in 20
years in a $5 million duel billed as "The Return Match of the Century
Between the Never-Defeated Champion of the World Bobby Fischer and His
Challenger Boris Spassky." Until the first move was actually played, many 
pundits didn't believe this return match would actually take place. Bobby 
surprised them in more ways than one, as his first game was virtually 
perfect. The assembled Grandmasters were left wondering if any time had 
passed at all. Fischer scored the necessary 10 wins (with 5 losses and 15 
draws) after 30 games and proved he still remembered how the pieces move 
before vanishing again -- probably forever.} 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6

bishop -- it must either take the knight or retreat.} 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Be7
6. Re1 b5 7. Bb3 d6 8. c3 O-O 9. h3 {Theory deems this better than 9. d4
Bg4!} 9... Nb8 {This retreat characterizes the Breyer variation of the Ruy 
Lopez. The Knight will reposition to d7, and moving it allows the c-pawn to 
advance. 9...Na5 is the main alternative.} 10. d4 Nbd7 11.Nbd2 Bb7 12. Bc2

Capturing en passant with 19...cxb3 20. Bxb3 Nc5 leaves the position fairly 
even and gets some breathing space along the c-file. But Spassky knew his 
opponent had something special prepared, and was rightly worried that 
Fischer would be well prepared for the obvious capture.} 20. Be3 h5 21. Qd2 
Rf8 22. Ra3 Ndf6 23. Rea1 Qd7 {As Dr. Tarrasch observed, "Cramped positions 
bear the germs of defeat." Instead of trying to contest the a-file Black 
should consider 23...Rb8 followed by Bc8-d7 to post his bishop on a better 
square.} 24. R1a2 Rfc8 25. Qc1 Bf8 26. Qa1 Qe8 27. Nf1 {White is following 
a remarkably direct plan to dominate the a-file after it is opened - and it 
will be opened by axb5 at White's discretion. Now the Knight is 
repositioned at b1 so that after mass exchanges it will be able to hop up to 
a3, probably winning the b5 pawn.} Be7 28. N1d2 Kg7 29. Nb1 Nxe4 {Weary of 
waiting, Spassky makes a desperate bid for freedom, sacrificing a piece to
shift the momentum from White's a-file buildup. This sort of sacrifice can
be especially effective when the opponent's pieces are all busy doing
something else, as they seem to be here. 29...Rab8, though unpleasant, may

{Korchnoi is fond of reversed openings, especially reversed Sicilians, where
White plays a position normally associated with the opposite color, with one
extra move in hand. Surprisingly only a few modern openings lend themselves
to this strategy; apparently even the best defenses gain from the fact that
as White, the opponent is expected to try to DO something. In Grandmaster
play, the player of the Black pieces is often content to draw, therefore a
strong defense can afford to be reactive rather than active.} 1. c4 e5 2. g3

weapon, promising play on the half-open c-file and along the long diagonal
of its fianchettoed Bishop. When the formation is played by White, many of
the most aggressive plans are no longer available to the opponent, such as
castling on opposite wings and pawn storming. For Black in this game, the
strategy would have been too slow. He therefore chooses a cautious plan,
which unfortunately allows White to control the pace.} 9... a5 10. Be3 Ra6

by the rules to establish a claim, and the arbiter later said that since
Kasparov's hand was still on the knight, he had the right to move it to
another square. "I was playing the World Champion and didn't want to cause
unpleasantness during my first invitation to such an important event,"
Polgar explained afterwards. "I was also afraid that if my complaint was
overruled I would be penalized on the clock when we were in time pressure."
A few days later The London Times carried a front page story, "Kasparov
Cheated, Opponent Claims." A video replay taken by a Spanish film crew
during the game showed that his hand did quit the piece for a mere fifth of
a second. Deliberate foul or an attempt to change his grip on the knight?

invitation to such an important event," she explained. "I was also afraid
that if my complaint was overruled I would be penalized on the clock when we

videotaped. Examination of the frames later determined Kasparov removed his
hand from his knight on move 36 for 1/4 of a second. "I have the feeling I
did not take my hand of the piece. My conscience is clear," he said. The

{Women's chess took a great leap forward in the 90s, prompting observers to
wonder whether separate titles for men and women should be abolished. Be
that as it may, Hungary's Susan Polgar dethroned China's Xie Jun by the
lopsided score of 8 1/2 - 4 1/2. Most games were exciting, but the defending
champion was hampered by inferior opening knowledge. "Chess literature is
still hard to get in China, but the game is getting very popular there,"
said Xie Jun. Trailing by a point before this game, she desperately sought
complications in order to even the score but faltered after only a dozen
moves.} 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 exd4 4. Nxd4 Bc5 5. Nxc6 Qf6 6. Qd2 dxc6

last chance to catch up, yet he lost the thread with a series of aimless

{Mexico's premier player Gilberto Hernandez, 25, was trounced 5 1/2 - 2 1/2

coax my opponents into attacking and to let them taste the joy of the
initiative so that they may get carried away, become careless, and sacrifice
material," said Korchnoi early in his career. This struggle illustrates his
philosophy in action. Not many players would coax White into building up
such a strong attack, but Korchnoi massed his heavy artillery along a
central file and coolly marched his king to safety on the queenside.} 1. e4

{FIDE recently nixed a unification match between Khalifman, their newly
crowned world champion, and Kasparov, the strongest player in the world.
With his usual 'modesty' Kasparov proclaimed: "There is no clear number two
in the world. The gulf is so wide and my superiority is so obvious that
sponsors fear a title match with any of my challengers won't generate much
interest." At the annual super tournament in Linares, six stars faced each

conducive to precise chess. The main feature of this double blind test is
the position that arose after 43. g4. The rules state that en passant
capture is optional, yet here it is forced, because it's the only way to

critical variation of the Slav Defense that has baffled theory for decades.
After only a dozen moves an ending is reached where Black has three pawns
for a piece. "In general I have the feeling that it might be slightly better
for White, although close to a draw," noted Kramnik, whose flawless endgame
technique helps avenge his loss of a match to Shirov in 1998.} 1. Nf3 d5 2.

{This game shows there is no turning back after creating permanent
weaknesses in the pawn structure when you go all-out to attack. Here,
leading Kasparov by 1/2 point going into the penultimate round, Shirov tried
to clinch first by ripping apart Black's kingside. Czech grandmaster
Movsesian, who once complained that players like him were as good as the top
10 but never got invited to major tournaments, shot back with spirited
defense.. Both sides went astray in the complications. The final result once
again proved the validity of Tartakower's maxim that the victor is he who
makes the next-to-the-last-mistake.} 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4

spectacular game at Linares. After hours of shadow-boxing, Kramnik launched
a ferocious attack that would have kayoed almost anyone else. Seemingly
unfazed by time pressure, Kasparov whipped up a wonderful counterattack to

defending his title against Anand in 1995. Brain Games Network (a private 
British dot-com entry that later was absorbed by Einstein TV in England) 
raised $2 million for a 16 game match with Kasparov's former apprentice, 
Vladimir Kramnik, 25. Their past record in 23 tournament games was 17 draws 
and 3 wins apiece -- a dead heat -- yet few fans gave the younger player much 
of a chance. Kasparov rated at 2830 was a huge favorite despite outranking 
his formidable foe by a mere 79 rating points. British bookies rated Kramnik 
as a 5-1 underdog, but after an initial draw the match suddenly was thrown

{After Bobby Fischer gave up competitive chess the crown remained in the 
hands of Russians whose names begin with K: Karpov, Kasparov -- until FIDE 
scrapped the system of long title matches and introduced a Wimbledon style 
knockout in 1999. 
Kramnik effectively revived the old Berlin Defense to the Ruy Lopez where 
both queens vanish on move 8. It was promptly dubbed the Berlin Wall and 
Kasparov failed to crack it in four games, which were all drawn, a result 
that greatly eased Kramniks defensive task with Black. After a sudden 
flurry of exchanges both players had three passed pawns on opposite sides of 
the board. "At some point I realized it would be drawn. It was not a good 
result from the opening," conceded Kasparov after an inauspicious start (a 
loss and a draw in the first two games). Meanwhile, adding to the pressure 
against him, Alexei Shirov filed a lawsuit against Kasparov in a Spanish 
court for $1.3 million in damages, claiming that he is the only legitimate 
challenger.}

{"The endgame doesnt seem to happen very often anymore," proclaimed Kasparov 
before this match began. Kramniks match strategy, however, was precisely to 
aim for queenless endgames as fast as possible and thus rob his renowned 
opponent of dynamic middle game tactics. Although drawn, this game was the 
longest and most exciting in the entire series. A draw seemed imminent 
after the queens were swapped on move 7, yet Kramnik stormed ahead with his 
kingside pawns to exploit an imperceptible edge. Kasparov, squirming, 
dropped a piece before the first time control at move 40. No one expected 
him to rescue the game but he fought back ferociously to find a Hail-Mary 
save. The finale turned into a comedy of errors when, after defending for 6 
1/2 hours, Kasparov tossed away the draw he had worked so hard to salvage. But 
Kramnik in turn succumbed to a blinding hallucination.}

{This game marked the end of an era. Kasparov, unable to win a single game 
out of 15 in the title match, later conceded that he was outprepared and 
outplayed. He seemed weary and depressed after suffering this second loss 
which sealed his fate. "I feel that my relationship with Kasparov now is much 
the same as before -- good," said Kramnik when it was all over. "He didnt 
have a chance to show his best chess. It can't be nice to lose your title 
after so long, but he took it with good grace and accepted me as the new 
World Champion."}

still have six games left and if I play like Im capable of playing, I

{Fans wonder if the traditional title, which always has been the main 
instrument for promoting chess, will even survive. A month after Kramnik 
scored a major upset by dethroning Kasparov in London, FIDE held its rival 
100-player knockout in India where native son Viswanathan Anand, 31, and 
Latvias Alexei Shirov, 28, reached the finals. Their brief playoff took 
place in Iran where chess was banned by Ayatollah Khomeini in 1989! Anand won 
easily (3 wins, 1 draw) but only FIDE loyalists regard him as the true 
champion because Kasparov trounced him in their 1995 title match. "A 
tournament filled largely with unknowns capped by a short match without 
much human drama doesnt excite a lot of interest except among dedicated 
chess junkies. FIDE forgot what Western man has known ever since Aristotle 
wrote about drama: We come to see tragic heroes, not the chorus," opined one 
critic. In this last game, trailing by two points, Shirov desperately 
sacrifices a piece to keep his hopes alive. Fireworks erupt but Anand, 
under fire, defended with his usual aplomb.}

{The line between classical and rapid chess became increasingly blurred in 
the new millennium when FIDE pushed for faster time controls in rated games. 
Most serious fans thought it was a terrible idea guaranteed only to produce 
poorly played games. Despite the decline in quality, however, events that 
took weeks were now finished in days.

After Vladimir Kramnik, 25, wrested the title from Kasparov, the first 
opponent he faced was Hungarys Peter Leko, 20, in a 12 game match at a speed 
of 25 minutes per side. Again utilizing the Berlin Defense, Kramnik won this 
series by two points (7-5). A year earlier Leko won a similar exhibition 
match at a regulation speed against newly crowned FIDE champion Alexander 
Khalifman. In this fascinating endgame Leko missed an incredible shot on 
move 64 found later by a computer. Its not clear that any player could find 
such a stunning resource over the board at any speed!}

to victory in this double round robin with 5 wins and 5 draws, 3 full points

rivalry was the greatest in chess history). At Linares, Kasparov posted a win

blunders creeping in; it is about emasculating the very content of the game," 
said Gary Kasparov, who fears that FIDEs fast new time limit will toll the 
death knell of classical chess.

FIDE champ Ruslan Ponomariov, 18, was eliminated at the outset by Chinas Zhu 
Chen, 26, the womens titleholder. Observers noted that it was the first time 
a womens world champion in any competition defeated her male counterpart. In 
their first game she pressed for 71 moves and missed a few wins before 
conceding a draw. Then, with Black, she scored this historic victory, albeit 
at a fast time limit.}

{Linares, which began in 1990, is usually the strongest tournament held 
each year. Kasparov has dominated the event by winning it eight times and 
finishing second twice. His performance at this super-tournament in 2002 
marked his ninth straight tournament victory in classical (slow) chess. He 
confirmed his number one ranking in grand style, outdistancing six hungry 
rivals with an 8-4 performance (4 wins, 8 draws). In the penultimate round 
he had the satisfaction of bashing FIDE champion Ruslan Ponomariov, 18, of 
the Ukraine, his runner-up who trailed by a full 1 points. At the closing 
ceremony Kasparov retracted all the harsh things about his young rival. 
"That was wrong and I will correct that. Ruslan made an excellent impression 
on me. He is very strong and I am sure that we will play many more games," 
generously conceded Kasparov.}

Shirov, who is a great fighter over the board, bravely sacrificed a piece 
for two pawns as early as move 11 in an exciting melee. Alas, Kasparov won, 
raising his overall score against Shirov to a stupefying 14-0 (not counting 
draws). They began a protracted feud when Kasparov choose Kramnik instead of 
Shirov as his challenger in 2000. Shirov, who had defeated Kramnik in a

{It takes more than money to produce a great chess culture, but subsidizing 
players cant hurt. Stalin did it when using chess to prove that the Soviet 
system was superior to the decadent West. Many Russian players died or 
dispersed to the four corners of the globe. Korchnoi defected to 
Switzerland, and Spassky moved to France where a new patron is determined to make 
that country a leading chess nation. Nadej Ojjeh, the daughter of Syrias 
longtime defense minister, poured a fortune from her deceased husbands oil 
and arms empire into chess. The first NAO tournament (bearing her initials) 
was the strongest ever held in France. The average age of ten players was 28, 
ranging from ex-world champion Anatoly Karpov (50) to French champion 
Etienne Bacrot (19). They both landed in a massive 5-way tie, 1 points 
behind Bulgarias Veselin Topalov, 26, and Israels Boris Gelfand, 33. 
Russias Alexander Morozevich, 24, ranked #5 in the world, was dead last, but 
his games were undeniably exciting. In this one Whites last move is simply 
superb. At the end every piece on the board is hanging, notably Blacks king.}
