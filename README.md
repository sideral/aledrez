JavaScript Chess GUI and chess engines in JavaScript and C# (2005)

This is one of my first personal projects. I am still proud of it, but don't read too much into it! It is a really old project, intented to run in IE6 (which, I'd argue, was an amazing browser back in 2004!). You will see a lot of awful practices that were normal back then. Still, I fell in love with programming and user interfaces while doing this project. IE6 actually allowed me to do some unusual stuff such as connecting a compiled ".exe" C# engine to a web UI, via something called HTAs, which were like Electron applications meant to be run on the desktop. Yes, it was possible to do that in 2004, and it was fun.
